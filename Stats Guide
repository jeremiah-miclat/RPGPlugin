📘 STAT SCALING & DAMAGE GUIDE (with Stat ÷ 100 explained)
💡 All stats in this system are divided by 100 before being used in formulas.
So if you have 125 STR, it becomes 1.25 for calculations.

⚙️ How Stats Are Calculated
How It's Used
Base stats	Taken from your class profile, then ÷ 100
Gear stats	Parsed from item lore (Strength: X) Also ÷ 100
Alchemist bonus	Gets +20% more from gear stats (rounded), then ÷ 100

📊 What Each Stat Does
Stat	Role in Combat
💪 Strength (STR)	Increases melee damage
🏹 Dexterity (DEX)	Increases ranged/trident damage; Archer crit chance
🧠 Intelligence (INT)	Boosts elemental skill damage
🍀 Luck (LUK)	Increases crit chance and crit multiplier
📈 StatDamage%	Multiplies total damage (from item lore only)

🧠 Damage Formula Reference
All stat values below are assumed to be already divided by 100!

✅ Base Damage Formula:
Melee:         STR × 4
Bow/Trident:   DEX × 4
Elemental:     Varies by class + skill

✅ Critical System:
Crit Chance:
🗡 Swordsman: LUK × 0.0003
🏹 Others: LUK × 0.0002
🏹 Archer: + DEX × 0.0001
🏹 Skill 3: +25% flat

Crit Multiplier:
1.5 + (LUK × 0.001)
+ (DEX × 0.00005) if Archer Skill 3
Crit Defense:

Target’s LUK × 0.0002 + item luck reduces your crit chance


⚔️ Class Skill Scaling (After ÷100)

🗡️ SWORDSMAN
Skill 1:
STR × 4 (melee)
INT × 8 (elemental)

🏹 ARCHER
Skill 1:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 6 (elemental)

Skill 2:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 4 (elemental)

Skill 3:
DEX × 4 (bow)
+25% crit chance
+DEX × 0.00005 to crit multiplier

⚗️ ALCHEMIST
Base potion throw:
INT × 30

Skill 1:
+INT × 1.2 extra if throwing a potion

Bonus:
+20% to all gear stats before division

📈 Final Damage Calculation
finalDamage = (baseDamage + STR/DEX/INT skills) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)
Example:
With STR = 1.25 (from 125 total), you get:
1.25 × 4 = 5 extra melee damage

If StatDamage% = 25 → multiply damage by 1.25 at the end.

🔔 Summary
✅ All stats are divided by 100 before use.
✅ Gear stats and base stats are combined.
✅ Alchemists get +20% from gear stats before dividing.
✅ Crit chance & multiplier scale with LUK (and a bit of DEX for Archers).
✅ StatDamage% is a final multiplier, only from item lore.






💖 VITALITY & AGILITY STAT GUIDE
🎓 All stats from your class and gear are divided by 100 before use.

💖 VITALITY → MAX HEALTH
✅ How It Works:
Base Health: 20 HP = ❤️ 10 hearts
+10 HP per 1.0 VIT

VIT comes from:
Your class profile (divided by 100)
Gear (divided by 100)

Alchemist: Gear VIT ×1.2 bonus

Final result multiplied by StatDamage% (gear bonus) = Final HP Multiplier

🧮 Formula:
Max HP = (20 + 10 × (classVIT + gearVIT)) × (1 + FinalHpMultiplier%)
📌 Example (Swordsman):
Class VIT: 125 → 1.25
Gear VIT: 75 → 0.75
Hp% from gear: 20% → 1.20x multiplier
Max HP = (20 + 10 × (1.25 + 0.75)) × 1.20  
       = (20 + 20) × 1.20 = 48 HP = ❤️ 24 hearts


🏃‍♂️ AGILITY → MOVEMENT SPEED
✅ How It Works:
Base Speed: 0.2
+0.0001 speed per 1.0 AGI
(1000 AGI = +0.1 speed)

Alchemist: Gear AGI ×1.2

Speed cap: 1.0

🧮 Formula:
Speed = min(0.2 + (classAGI + gearAGI) × 0.0001, 1.0)

📌 Example (Archer):
Class AGI: 300
Gear AGI: 200
Not an Alchemist

Speed = 0.2 + (300 + 200) × 0.0001  
      = 0.2 + 0.05 = 0.25

⚠️ RECOMMENDED AGILITY
➤ Max useful speed:
Speed cap = 1.0 → max bonus = 0.8

To reach 0.8 bonus speed:
(AGI × 0.0001) = 0.8 → AGI = 8000
🔻 AGI beyond 8000 gives no extra movement.
💡 We recommend 2000–3000 AGI for efficiency unless you're going for a meme build.
