📘 STAT SCALING & DAMAGE GUIDE
💡 Important Note:
Only STR, DEX, INT, and VIT are divided by 100 when used in calculations.
LUK, AGI, and StatDamage% are used directly (not divided by 100).

⚙️ How Stats Are Calculated
Source	How It's Used
Base stats	Taken from your class profile. STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Gear stats	Parsed from item lore (e.g. “Strength: X”). STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Alchemist	Gets +20% more from gear stats (before ÷ 100).

📊 What Each Stat Does
Stat	Role in Combat
💪 STR	Boosts melee damage. (÷100 before used)
🏹 DEX	Boosts bow/trident damage and archer crit chance. (÷100 before used)
🧠 INT	Increases elemental skill damage. (÷100 before used)
💖 VIT	Increases max health. (÷100 before used)
🍀 LUK	Increases crit chance and crit multiplier. (✅ Used as-is)
🏃 AGI	Increases melee attack speed, projectile damage, and Evasion Chance. (✅ Used as-is)
📈 StatDamage%	Final damage multiplier from gear. (✅ Used as-is)

🧠 DAMAGE FORMULAS
🔹 All STR, DEX, and INT values below are assumed already divided by 100.

✅ Basic Damage:
Melee: STR × 4
Bow/Trident: DEX × 4

Elemental: Class + Skill-based

================================================================================================

✅ Critical System

Crit Chance:
Class/Type	Formula
🗡 Swordsman	LUK × 0.0003
🏹 Archer	LUK × 0.0003 + DEX × 0.0001
🏹 Archer + Skill 3	+25% flat on top of above
❔ Others	LUK × 0.0002

Crit Multiplier:
1.5 + (LUK × 0.001)

If Archer + Skill 3: + DEX × 0.00005

Crit Defense (target):
Reduces your crit chance:
Target LUK × 0.0002 + item-based luck resistance


=================================================================
⚔️ CLASS SKILL SCALING
(Again, STR/DEX/INT in formulas below are assumed ÷ 100)

🗡️ SWORDSMAN
Skill 1:
STR × 4 (melee)
INT × 8 (elemental)


🏹 ARCHER
Skill 1:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 8 (elemental)

Skill 2:
DEX × 4
INT × 6

Skill 3:
DEX × 4
+25% crit chance
+DEX × 0.00005 to crit multiplier
Crossbow heals 5% of damage dealt (5% lifesteal effect)

⚗️ ALCHEMIST
Potion Throw
INT × 3 vs players
INT × 10 vs mobs

Skill 1: +20% damage from INT
Bonus:
+20% to all gear stats before division (STR/DEX/INT/VIT/AGI)

=====================================================================

📈 FINAL DAMAGE CALCULATION

finalDamage = (baseDamage + skillBonus) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)

📌 Example (Melee):
STR = 125 → 1.25
Melee Bonus: 1.25 × 4 = 5
StatDamage% = 25 → multiply final by 1.25
➜ finalDamage = (base + 5) × 1.25

💖 VITALITY & HEALTH GUIDE
✅ Max HP Formula:
Max HP = (20 + 10 × (classVIT + gearVIT)) × (1 + FinalHpMultiplier%)
Base Health = 20 HP (10 hearts)
+10 HP per 1.0 VIT

Alchemist: Gear VIT × 1.2 before division
📌 Example:
Class VIT = 125 → 1.25
Gear VIT = 75 → 0.75
Hp% = 20% → ×1.20
➜ (20 + 10 × (1.25 + 0.75)) × 1.2 = 48 HP = ❤️ 24 hearts

🏃‍♂️ AGILITY
✅ Speed Formula:
AGI is not divided
Alchemist: Gear AGI × 1.2 before applying

Every 1000 gives 10% bonus attackspeed
Every 1000 gives 10% bonus final projectile damage

🏃‍♂️ PvE Evasion (vs Monsters)
Your evasion rate scales based on your AGI per level, with a soft cap at 80%.

AGI	Level	AGI/Level	Evasion
50	1	    50	        80% ✅
100	1	    100	        100% 🔥
200	2	    100	        100% ✅
50	2	    25	        40%
400	4	    100	        100% ✅
300	3	    100	        100% ✅
150	3	    50	        80% ✅

⚙️ Formula:
evade = min(80, (AGI / (Level × 50)) × 80)
➡️ You need 50 AGI per level of monster for 80% evasion
➡️ 100 AGI per level of monster guarantees 100% evasion

🧮 Evasion vs Monsters:
Your AGI is divided by the monster’s level to determine how effective it is.
➡️ More AGI is needed to dodge higher-level monsters.
Example:
If you're Level 1 with 100 AGI vs a Level 2 monster, your AGI is worth 50 per level, not 100.
