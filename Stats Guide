📘 STAT SCALING & DAMAGE GUIDE (with Stat ÷ 100 explained)
💡 All stats in this system are divided by 100 before being used in formulas.
So if you have 125 STR, it becomes 1.25 for calculations.

⚙️ How Stats Are Calculated
How It's Used
Base stats	Taken from your class profile, then ÷ 100
Gear stats	Parsed from item lore (Strength: X) Also ÷ 100
Alchemist bonus	Gets +20% more from gear stats (rounded), then ÷ 100

📊 What Each Stat Does
Stat	Role in Combat
💪 Strength (STR)	Increases melee damage
🏹 Dexterity (DEX)	Increases ranged/trident damage; Archer crit chance
🧠 Intelligence (INT)	Boosts elemental skill damage
🍀 Luck (LUK)	Increases crit chance and crit multiplier
📈 StatDamage%	Multiplies total damage (from item lore only)

🧠 Damage Formula Reference
All stat values below are assumed to be already divided by 100!

✅ Base Damage Formula:
Melee:         STR × 4
Bow/Trident:   DEX × 4
Elemental:     Varies by class + skill

✅ Critical System:
Crit Chance:
🗡 Swordsman: LUK × 0.0003
🏹 Others: LUK × 0.0002
🏹 Archer: + DEX × 0.0001
🏹 Skill 3: +25% flat

Crit Multiplier:
1.5 + (LUK × 0.001)
+ (DEX × 0.00005) if Archer Skill 3
Crit Defense:

Target’s LUK × 0.0002 + item luck reduces your crit chance


⚔️ Class Skill Scaling (After ÷100)

🗡️ SWORDSMAN
Skill 1:
STR × 4 (melee)
INT × 8 (elemental)

🏹 ARCHER
Skill 1:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 6 (elemental)

Skill 2:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 4 (elemental)

Skill 3:
DEX × 4 (bow)
+25% crit chance
+DEX × 0.00005 to crit multiplier

⚗️ ALCHEMIST
Base potion throw:
INT × 30

Skill 1:
+INT × 1.2 extra if throwing a potion

Bonus:
+20% to all gear stats before division

📈 Final Damage Calculation
finalDamage = (baseDamage + STR/DEX/INT skills) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)
Example:
With STR = 1.25 (from 125 total), you get:
1.25 × 4 = 5 extra melee damage

If StatDamage% = 25 → multiply damage by 1.25 at the end.

🔔 Summary
✅ All stats are divided by 100 before use.
✅ Gear stats and base stats are combined.
✅ Alchemists get +20% from gear stats before dividing.
✅ Crit chance & multiplier scale with LUK (and a bit of DEX for Archers).
✅ StatDamage% is a final multiplier, only from item lore.
