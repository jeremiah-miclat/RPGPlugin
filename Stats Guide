📘 STAT SCALING & DAMAGE GUIDE
💡 Important Note:
Only STR, DEX, INT, and VIT are divided by 100 when used in calculations.
LUK, AGI, and StatDamage% are used directly (not divided by 100).

⚙️ How Stats Are Calculated
Source	How It's Used
Base stats	Taken from your class profile. STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Gear stats	Parsed from item lore (e.g. “Strength: X”). STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Alchemist	Gets +20% more from gear stats (before ÷ 100).

📊 What Each Stat Does
Stat	Role in Combat
💪 STR	Boosts melee damage, increases max HP by +5 per 1.0 STR. (÷100 before used)
🏹 DEX	Boosts bow/trident damage and archer crit chance. (÷100 before used)
🧠 INT	Increases elemental skill damage. (÷100 before used)
💖 VIT	Increases max health. (÷100 before used)
🍀 LUK	Increases crit chance and crit multiplier. (✅ Used as-is)
🏃 AGI	Increases melee attack speed, projectile damage, and Evasion Chance. (✅ Used as-is)
📈 StatDamage%	Final damage multiplier from gear. (✅ Used as-is)

🧠 DAMAGE FORMULAS
🔹 All STR, DEX, and INT values below are assumed already divided by 100.

✅ Basic Damage:
*Melee:
Base = STR × 4
If STR > DEX → Bonus = DEX × 3
If DEX > STR → Bonus = DEX × 4
Final = (Base + Bonus) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)

*Bow/Trident: DEX × 4

*Splash Potion:
INT × 8 vs players
INT × 30 vs mobs

If INT > DEX → Bonus = DEX × 4
If DEX > INT → Bonus = DEX × 2

================================================================================================

✅ Critical Hit System

🎯 Crit Chance (based on stats and class)
Class/Type	Crit Chance Formula
🗡 Swordsman	+0.03% per LUK
🏹 Archer	+0.03% per LUK and +0.01% per DEX
🏹 Archer + Skill 3	Above + flat +25% bonus
❔ Others	+0.02% per LUK

💥 Crit Damage Multiplier

Starts at 1.5x
Gains +0.1x every 100 LUK
If Archer + Skill 3: gains extra +0.05x every 100 DEX

🛡 Crit Resistance (PVP Enemy Defense)

🛡️ Critical Resistance Guide

Crit Resistance Formula
+0.02% per AGI
+0.02% per VIT
+0.02% per LUK
+0.02% per HP%

📌 Example Calculation

You (Defender):
200 LUK → 200 × 0.02% = 4%
100 VIT → 100 × 0.02% = 2%
50 AGI → 50 × 0.02% = 1%
Base Crit Resistance = 7%

Player Swordsman (Attacker):
1000 LUK → 1000 × 0.03% = 30%

Final Crit chance of attacker:
30 - 7 = 23%

=================================================================
⚔️ CLASS SKILL SCALING
(Again, STR/DEX/INT in formulas below are assumed ÷ 100)

🗡️ SWORDSMAN
Skill 1 SWORDSMAN:
STR × 4
INT × 4
DEX * 2



🏹 ARCHER
Skill 1 ARCHER:
DEX × 4
INT × 4

Skill 2 ARCHER:
DEX × 4
INT × 6

Skill 3 ARCHER:
DEX × 4
+25% crit chance
+DEX × 0.00005 to crit multiplier
Crossbow heals 5% of damage dealt (5% lifesteal effect)

⚗️ ALCHEMIST
Potion Throw
INT × 4 vs players
INT × 8 vs mobs
DEX * 2

Skill 1 ALCHEMIST: +20% damage from INT
Bonus:
+20% to all gear stats before division (STR/DEX/INT/VIT/AGI)

=====================================================================

📈 FINAL DAMAGE CALCULATION

finalDamage = (baseDamage + skillBonus) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)

📌 Example (Melee):
STR = 125 → 1.25
Melee Bonus: 1.25 × 4 = 5
StatDamage% = 25 → multiply final by 1.25
➜ finalDamage = (base + 5) × 1.25

💖 VITALITY & HEALTH GUIDE
✅ Max HP Formula:
Max HP = (20 + 12 × (classVIT + gearVIT)) × (1 + FinalHpMultiplier%)
Base Health = 20 HP (10 hearts)
+10 HP per 1.0 VIT
1 vit = Raw Damage Received -1 (PVE)
1 vit = Damage Received from attacker stat -1 (PVP)
Alchemist: Gear VIT × 1.2 before division

🏃‍♂️ AGILITY
✅ Attack Speed Formula:
AGI is not divided
Alchemist: Gear AGI × 1.2 before applying

Attack Speed Bonus from AGI (melee)
Formula basis: AGI per level (agi / level) determines bonus attack speed.

Explanation:
From 0 → 50 AGI/lvl, bonus scales linearly from 0% to 100%.
Example: 25 AGI/lvl → 50% bonus
From 50 → 100 AGI/lvl, bonus scales linearly from 100% → 300%.
Example: 75 AGI/lvl → 200% bonus
For 100 AGI/lvl and above, bonus is capped at 300%.



Damage Multiplier from AGI (Long Range & Splash)
Formula basis: AGI per level (agi / level) also determines extra damage.



Explanation:
From 0 → 50 AGI/lvl, damage multiplier scales linearly from x1 → x2.
Example: 25 AGI/lvl → x1.5 damage
From 50 → 100 AGI/lvl, damage multiplier scales linearly from x2 → x4.
Example: 75 AGI/lvl → x3 damage
For 100 AGI/lvl and above, multiplier is capped at x4.

Summary: Higher AGI per level directly boosts damage, with smooth scaling and a hard cap.



🏃‍♂️ PvE Evasion (vs Monsters)
Your evasion rate scales based on your AGI per level, with a soft cap at 80%.

AGI	m.lvl	AGI/Level	Evasion
25	1	    25	        80% ✅
50	1	    50	        100% 🔥
100	2	    50	        100% ✅
25	2	    12.5	        40%
200	4	    50	        100% ✅
150	3	    50	        100% ✅
75	3	    25	        80% ✅

⚙️ Formula:
evade = min(80, (AGI / (Level × 25)) × 80)
➡️ You need 25 AGI per level of monster for 80% evasion
➡️ 50 AGI per level of monster guarantees 100% evasion

🧮 Evasion vs Monsters:
Your AGI is divided by the monster’s level to determine how effective it is.
➡️ More AGI is needed to dodge higher-level monsters.
Example:
If you're Level 1 with 50 AGI vs a Level 2 monster, your AGI is worth 25 per level, not 50.




🎯 Guide to Cooldown Reduction from Dexterity
In this system, your Dexterity (DEX) directly reduces your skill cooldowns. The reduction depends on your DEX compared to your Level, not just raw DEX.
The formula behind the scenes looks at Dexterity per Level (DEX ÷ Level). This makes sure cooldown reduction stays balanced no matter what level you are.

🔹 Step 1: Calculate Dexterity per Level
To determine your cooldown reduction (CDR), first calculate:
Dexterity per Level = DEX ÷ Level
Example:
100 DEX at Level 5 → 100 ÷ 5 = 20s
200 DEX at Level 10 → 200 ÷ 10 = 20s

👉 Even though the first player has 100 DEX and the second has 200 DEX, they both have the same 20 DEX/Level ratio, so their cooldown reduction is identical.

🔹 Step 2: Apply Cooldown Reduction Rules
Depending on your DEX per Level ratio, cooldown reduction follows three different zones:

🟢 Zone 1: Low Dexterity (0–19 DEX/Level)
Formula: (DEX per Level ÷ 20) × 15
Cooldown reduction gradually increases from 0 up to 15s.

Examples:
10 DEX/Level → 7.5s CDR
20 DEX/Level → 15s CDR

🟡 Zone 2: Mid Dexterity (20–39 DEX/Level)
Formula: 15 + ((DEX per Level – 20) ÷ 20) × 14
Cooldown reduction starts at 15% and scales up to 29s.

Examples:
25 DEX/Level → 18.5s CDR
30 DEX/Level → 22s CDR
39 DEX/Level → 28.3s CDR

🔴 Zone 3: High Dexterity (40+ DEX/Level)
Cooldown reduction is capped at 29s.
No matter how much more Dexterity you stack, you cannot exceed 29s reduction.

Examples:
40 DEX/Level → 29s CDR
60 DEX/Level → 29s CDR (cap)

📊 Quick Reference Table
DEX	Level	DEX/Level	Cooldown Reduction
20	2	    10	            7.5s
100	5	    20	            15s
150	5	    30	            22s
200	5	    40	            29s (cap)
500	10	    50	            29s (cap)
