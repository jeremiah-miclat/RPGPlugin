📘 STAT SCALING & DAMAGE GUIDE
💡 Important Note:
Only STR, DEX, INT, and VIT are divided by 100 when used in calculations.
LUK, AGI, and StatDamage% are used directly (not divided by 100).

⚙️ How Stats Are Calculated
Source	How It's Used
Base stats	Taken from your class profile. STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Gear stats	Parsed from item lore (e.g. “Strength: X”). STR/DEX/INT/VIT are ÷ 100.
Alchemist	Gets +20% more from gear stats (before ÷ 100).

📊 What Each Stat Does
Stat	Role in Combat
💪 STR	Boosts melee damage. (÷100 before used)
🏹 DEX	Boosts bow/trident damage and archer crit chance. (÷100 before used)
🧠 INT	Increases elemental skill damage. (÷100 before used)
💖 VIT	Increases max health. (÷100 before used)
🍀 LUK	Increases crit chance and crit multiplier. (✅ Used as-is)
🏃 AGI	Increases movement speed. (✅ Used as-is)
📈 StatDamage%	Final damage multiplier from gear. (✅ Used as-is)

🧠 DAMAGE FORMULAS
🔹 All STR, DEX, and INT values below are assumed already divided by 100.

✅ Basic Damage:
Melee: STR × 4
Bow/Trident: DEX × 4

Elemental: Class + Skill-based

================================================================================================

✅ Critical System

Crit Chance:
Class/Type	Formula
🗡 Swordsman	LUK × 0.0003
🏹 Archer	LUK × 0.0003 + DEX × 0.0001
🏹 Archer + Skill 3	+25% flat on top of above
❔ Others	LUK × 0.0002

Crit Multiplier:
1.5 + (LUK × 0.001)

If Archer + Skill 3: + DEX × 0.00005

Crit Defense (target):
Reduces your crit chance:
Target LUK × 0.0002 + item-based luck resistance


=================================================================
⚔️ CLASS SKILL SCALING
(Again, STR/DEX/INT in formulas below are assumed ÷ 100)

🗡️ SWORDSMAN
Skill 1:
STR × 4 (melee)
INT × 8 (elemental)


🏹 ARCHER
Skill 1:
DEX × 4 (bow)
INT × 8 (elemental)

Skill 2:
DEX × 4
INT × 6

Skill 3:
DEX × 4
+25% crit chance
+DEX × 0.00005 to crit multiplier

⚗️ ALCHEMIST
Potion Throw
INT × 3 vs players
INT × 10 vs mobs

Skill 1: +20% damage from INT
Bonus:
+20% to all gear stats before division (STR/DEX/INT/VIT/AGI)

=====================================================================

📈 FINAL DAMAGE CALCULATION

finalDamage = (baseDamage + skillBonus) × (1 + StatDamage% / 100)

📌 Example (Melee):
STR = 125 → 1.25
Melee Bonus: 1.25 × 4 = 5
StatDamage% = 25 → multiply final by 1.25
➜ finalDamage = (base + 5) × 1.25

💖 VITALITY & HEALTH GUIDE
✅ Max HP Formula:
Max HP = (20 + 10 × (classVIT + gearVIT)) × (1 + FinalHpMultiplier%)
Base Health = 20 HP (10 hearts)
+10 HP per 1.0 VIT

Alchemist: Gear VIT × 1.2 before division
📌 Example:
Class VIT = 125 → 1.25
Gear VIT = 75 → 0.75
Hp% = 20% → ×1.20
➜ (20 + 10 × (1.25 + 0.75)) × 1.2 = 48 HP = ❤️ 24 hearts

🏃‍♂️ AGILITY & SPEED GUIDE
✅ Speed Formula:
Speed = min(0.2 + (classAGI + gearAGI) × 0.0001, 1.0)
AGI is not divided
Base speed = 0.2
+0.0001 speed per AGI point
Max speed = 1.0

Alchemist: Gear AGI × 1.2 before applying
📌 Example:
Class AGI = 300
Gear AGI = 200
➜ Speed = 0.2 + 500 × 0.0001 = 0.25

⚠️ Recommended AGI
8000 AGI = speed cap (0.8 bonus)
Recommended: 2000–3000 AGI unless you're going full-speed build
